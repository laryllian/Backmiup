DESCRIPTION
       This little program produces incremental backups of a specified folder within another given folder.  It
       creates  time-labeled  snapshots  and makes it therefore easy to find and recover old versions of files
       and deleted ones. The focus however, lies in the built-in encrypted network transfer support using SSH,
       which  lets  you  do  secure  backups via Internet from wherever you might be. Due to the genial delta-
       transfer algorithm (thanks to the rsync team) only the parts of your data that have changed are  trans‚Äê
       ferred.  Furthermore,  connection  losses  and  occasional short uptimes of the computer do not matter,
       since the backup process is always automatically resumed later on. All backups appear as full  backups,
       but only changed files are really stored in new backups, unchanged files are hard linked.

TODO
- periodically clean logs
- the deletion times dont work correctly yet
